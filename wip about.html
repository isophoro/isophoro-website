            <h2>Hello! My name is Chris, but online you may know me as isophoro! I'm known for my programming/coding,
                which is what this website is about!<br>
                I'm 15, and I'm a Junior in high school. My birthday is September 30th! <br>
                I also have an amazing, loving girlfriend, whom I love very much.<br><br>
                I'm mostly known for programming Friday Night Funkin' mods, especially since that's what I started out
                with, but I'm also programming<br>for some real games!<br><br>Sometimes, I may post my "game doodles"
                here, at the very bottom of the games section, but maybe I'll give it it's own section.<br>
                I am also thinking about a blog/article section, that can sometimes just be me rambling about code.
                <br><br>
                I have been programming for approximately 4-5 years, beginning with HaxeFlixel. I am eager to continue
                expanding my knowledge and skills!<br>
                Current engines I know include:<br><br>* HaxeFlixel<br>* GameMaker Studio 2<br>* Unity (A tiny
                bit!)<br><br>
                I've been very interested in learning Godot recently.
                <br><br>

                <br>
                Stream Ziffy please. I love you Ziffy. Ziffy music for life.

                Here's my song of the... forever!

            <h2>This is around the third time I've made this site, firstly being hosted on <a
                    href="https://isophoro.neocities.org/">Neocities</a>! Then, being hosted on a web builder host, and
                now being fully programmed by me (with the help of some tutorials, so it might still be a little jank!).
                It's being programmed with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, while being hosted with Amazon S3 (AWS). The
                domain's
                registration is through Namecheap!<br><br>
                I want this site to be somewhere I can go to ramble, talk about projects, or even help other people
                program! It's also doubling down as my personal portfolio.
                <br><br>Thank you all for visiting!<br><br><br>
